# Datasets
Google Colab is a very amazing tool. Free gpu use for 12 hour intervals is great. The problem is, accessing google drive from colab is a pain
Kaggle is an amazing tool because of the datasets. However, it is quite terrible because of the complete lack of storage.
This has the datasets I use for my projects in Google Colab
